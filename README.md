# Dunkin' Do-maps
## Building Interactive Maps with Streamlit and PyDeck

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the interactive functionality of PyDeck and Streamlit 
to display geo-spatial data that users can derive information from quickly and easily. 

The interactive tool produced will: 
   * Show users where Dunkin' Donuts locations are
   * Allow a user to enter a general search area to find a Dunkin' Donuts near them
   * Allow a user to filter the available Dunkin' Donuts locations by certain features:
       * Opening times 
       * Drive Thru availability
       * Whether they accept Dunkin' Card
       * Baskin Robbins availability
       * Mobile order availability
